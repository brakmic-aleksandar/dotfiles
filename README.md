My dotfiles. DISCLAIMER: Choking hazard.

## Setup
Clone this repo, and run install(requires python) script afterwards. 
The script will create symlinks to config entries, if entry already exists it will add sufix ".backup" to its name.

**NOTE: If you are running tmux with version lower than 3.1, you'll have to move/symlink tmux config from .config folder to your user folder**
